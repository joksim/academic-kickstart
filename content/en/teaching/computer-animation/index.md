# Basic information

## Course code(s)
- **`CSES806`** - for undergraduate studies from 2013 until 2017
- **`F18L3S113`** - for undergraduate studies from 2018

## Prerequisites
*Computer Graphics (`F18L2S114`)* **or** *Human-computer interaction design (`F18L3S010`)*

## Course overview
  Computer animation is a design-oriented course that introduces the basics of general purpose 3D software.

# Instructor information
- **professor:** [Ivan Chorbev, PhD](https://finki.ukim.mk/en/staff/ivan-chorbev)
- **teaching assistant:** [Boban Joksimoski, MSc](https://finki.ukim.mk/en/staff/boban-joksimoski)

# Course goals
  The course is an introduction into computer animation. It teaches basic techniques for creating 3D computer animations.

# Technical requirements and software
  - A computer with good performance is desirable. Preferably with a good discrete GPU (*NVidia* or *AMD*).
  - [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) - preferred 3D software, an industry standard. To obtain in for learning purposes, please apply for a student account on the official Autodesk site [here](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya).
  

# Course structure
  The lectures and exercises and thought together, in an interactive way. The laboratory exercises are on a weekly basis.

  The syllabus is structured as follows:
  
  1. Introduction, history and overview of the field.
  2. Introduction to the 3D environment, basic concepts and interface overview.
  3. Concepts of 3D modeling. Polygonal, NURBS and subdivision modeling. UV coordinates.
  4. Deformations and rigging.
  5. Animation.
  6. Materials and textures.
  7. Lightning and camera.
  8. Rendering and compositing
  9. Scripting and the 3D pipeline.

[//]: # "Course policies"

# Grading and assessments
  The course is oriented towards independent working. You must attend the
  laboratory exercises to be able to complete the course. Only **one absence**
  from the laboratory exercises is tolerated.


  The final grade is calculated as follows:
  
  - **laboratory exercises (20%)** - presented weekly.
  - **homework assignments (20%)** - 2 homeworks during the semester.
  - **midterm (1<sup>st</sup> partial) exam (20%)** - done once in the middle of the semester.
  - **project work (40%)** - agreed with the teachers. It can be submitted in one of the three exam sessions. Accordingly there is a penalty for each following session:
    + *up to 100%* if finished in the 1<sup>st</sup> exam session (June/July). Translates up to 40% percent of the total points.
    + *up to 90%* if finished in the 2<sup>nd</sup> exam session (August/September). Translates up to 36% of the total points.
    + *up to 75%* if finished in the 3<sup>rd</sup> exam session (January/February). Translates up to 30% of the total points.

  The project is **mandatory** and students can not pass the course without submitting it.
