- **professor:** [Ivan Chorbev, PhD](https://finki.ukim.mk/en/staff/ivan-chorbev)
- **teaching assistant:** [Boban Joksimoski, MSc](https://finki.ukim.mk/en/staff/boban-joksimoski)

# Course goals
  The course is an introduction into computer animation. It teaches basic techniques for creating 3D computer animations.

# Course structure
  The lectures and exercises and thought together, in an interactive way. The laboratory exercises are on a weekly basis.

  The syllabus is structured as follows:
  
  1. Introduction, history and overview of the field.
  2. Introduction to the 3D environment (Autodesk Maya), basic concepts and interface overview.
  3. Concepts of 3D modeling. Polygonal, NURBS and subdivision modeling. UV coordinates.
  4. Deformations and rigging.
  5. Animation.
  6. Materials and textures.
  7. Lightning and camera.
  8. Rendering and compositing
  9. Intro to scripting and the 3D pipeline.

# Grading and assessments
  The course is oriented towards independent working. You must attend the
  laboratory exercises to be able to complete the course. Only **one absence**
  from the laboratory exercises is tolerated.


  The final grade is calculated as follows:
  
  - **laboratory exercises (20%)** - presented weekly.
  - **homework assignments (20%)** - 2 homeworks during the semester.
  - **1st partial exam (20%)** - done once in the middle of the semester.
  - **project work (40%)** - agreed with the teachers. It can be finished in one
    of the three seesions. Accordingly there is a 10% point penalty for each
    following session:
    + up to 100% if finished in the 1<sup>st</sup> exam session (June/July)
    + up to 90% if finished in the 2<sup>nd</sup> exam session (August/September) 
    + up to 80% if finished in the 3<sup>rd</sup> exam session (August/September)
