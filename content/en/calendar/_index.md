My office hours are displayed on the calendar below (updated daily) and it is the most accurate information about my responsibilities. My office hours are also displayed on my [faculty page](https://finki.ukim.mk/mk/staff/boban-joksimoski). 

It is better if you contact me using my official e-mail address (that can be found on the [faculty page](https://finki.ukim.mk/mk/staff/boban-joksimoski)). Please DO NOT use this site's [contact form](https://joksim.github.io#contact) for teacher-student communication.

If I do not answer to your message in 24 hours, please resend it. **It is very helpful if you adhere to good e-mail etiquette**. Here are some good examples:
